	abstract = {High throughput spatial transcriptomics (HST) is a rapidly emerging class of experimental technologies that allow for profiling gene expression in tissue samples at or near single-cell resolution while retaining the spatial location of each sequencing unit within the tissue sample. Through analyzing HST data, we seek to identify sub-populations within a tissue sample that reflect distinct cell types or states. Existing methods either ignore the spatial heterogeneity in gene expression profiles, fail to account for important statistical features such as skewness, or are heuristic-based network clustering methods that lack the inferential benefits of statistical modeling. To address this gap, we develop SPRUCE: a Bayesian spatial multivariate finite mixture model based on multivariate skew-normal distributions, which is capable of identifying distinct cellular sub-populations in HST data. We further implement a novel combination of P{\'o}lya{\textendash}Gamma data augmentation and spatial random effects to infer spatially correlated mixture component membership probabilities without relying on approximate inference techniques. Via a simulation study, we demonstrate the detrimental inferential effects of ignoring skewness or spatial correlation in HST data. Using publicly available human brain HST data, SPRUCE outperforms existing methods in recovering expertly annotated brain layers. Finally, our application of SPRUCE to human breast cancer HST data indicates that SPRUCE can distinguish distinct cell populations within the tumor microenvironment.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {High-throughput profiling of in situ gene expression represents a major advance towards the systematic understanding of tissue complexity. Applied with enough capture area and high sample throughput it will help to define the spatio-temporal dynamics of gene expression in tissues and organisms. Yet, current technologies have considerable bottlenecks that limit widespread application. Here, we have combined DNA nanoball (DNB) patterned array chips and in situ RNA capture to develop Stereo-seq (Spatio-Temporal Enhanced REsolution Omics-sequencing). This approach allows high sample throughput transcriptomic profiling of histological sections at unprecedented (nanoscale) resolution with areas expandable to centimeter scale, high sensitivity and homogenous capture rate. As proof of principle, we applied Stereo-seq to the adult mouse brain and sagittal sections of E11.5 and E16.5 mouse embryos. Thanks to its unique features and amenability to additional modifications, Stereo-seq can pave the way for the systematic spatially resolved-omics characterization of tissues and organisms.Competing Interest StatementThe chip, procedure and applications of Stereo-seq are covered in pending patents.

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing can provide information about cellular relationships based on shared transcriptomes, but most methods lose spatial information. Those methods that do retain spatial information can be limited to a specific set of genes and/or a small area. Srivatsan et al. introduce sci-Space, a spatial transcriptomic method that uses a grid of barcoded oligos on a slide that can be transferred to nuclei of an overlaid frozen tissue section to obtain both the spatial origin and the transcriptome of thousands of single cells per slide. The researchers used sci-Space to create a spatial atlas of mouse E14 sagittal sections, revealing spatially expressed genes across cell types. This application illustrates how sci-Space complements existing approaches in spatial genomics.Science, abb9536, this issue p. 111Spatial patterns of gene expression manifest at scales ranging from local (e.g., cell-cell interactions) to global (e.g., body axis patterning). However, current spatial transcriptomics methods either average local contexts or are restricted to limited fields of view. Here, we introduce sci-Space, which retains single-cell resolution while resolving spatial heterogeneity at larger scales. Applying sci-Space to developing mouse embryos, we captured approximate spatial coordinates and whole transcriptomes of about 120,000 nuclei. We identify thousands of genes exhibiting anatomically patterned expression, leverage spatial information to annotate cellular subtypes, show that cell types vary substantially in their extent of spatial patterning, and reveal correlations between pseudotime and the migratory patterns of differentiating neurons. Looking forward, we anticipate that sci-Space will facilitate the construction of spatially resolved single-cell atlases of mammalian development.},
